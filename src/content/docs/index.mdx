  title: Self-hosted workflow engine
  tagline: An “observable + replayable” execution platform for long-running automation. Persisted state & outputs, real-time log/event streams, and isolated execution (Runner/Sandbox) so automation isn’t a black-box script anymore.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Persistent & traceable" icon="open-book">
    States and results are persisted (SQLite), with a complete record for every run. Retry, rerun, or replay after failures—avoid the unpredictability of one-off scripts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time observability & replay" icon="rocket">
    Stream logs and events as execution happens. Inspect/download inputs, outputs, files, and artifacts to debug faster—and make reproduction and auditing straightforward.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Isolated execution (executor + sandbox)" icon="document">
    In production, split “orchestration & state” from “execution & isolation”: the control plane schedules and persists, while executors run in sandboxed containers and report logs and artifacts back.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable workflow graphs" icon="puzzle">
    Break work into steps with clear inputs/outputs, explicit dependencies, and deliverable artifacts—ideal for evolving ad-hoc scripts into long-lived, maintainable automation systems.
  </Card>
