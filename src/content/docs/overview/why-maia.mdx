Maia is a self-hosted workflow orchestration and execution service. It uses a `DAG` structure and is designed for long-running automation.

## Core capabilities

- **Persistence**: keep state, inputs, outputs, logs, and artifacts over time.
- **Observability**: stream real-time logs and events via `SSE`; inspect step inputs, outputs, and artifacts.
- **Replay**: replay an execution after it finishes.
- **Isolated execution**: optionally execute with Runner (recommended for production); otherwise App executes locally.
- **Composability**: explicit step dependencies; upstream outputs flow downstream by stepKey; supports input and output specs.

## Use cases

- **Data pipelines**: fetch, clean, transform, and aggregate; resume from failures.
- **Scheduled jobs**: backups, health checks, and report generation; needs stable scheduling and traceability.
- **API orchestration**: coordinate multiple APIs and aggregate results; needs a debuggable history.
- **Batch processing**: process many files/records with concurrency control and progress visibility.
