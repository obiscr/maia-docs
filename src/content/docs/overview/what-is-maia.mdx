Maia is a self-hosted DAG workflow orchestration and execution service for long-running automation—observable, debuggable, and replayable.

- **Persistence**: state and outputs are persisted with SQLite (retained and traceable)
- **Observability**: real-time logs/event streams (SSE) with replay
- **Isolated execution**: optional Runner + Sandbox container isolation (recommended for production)
- **Composable**: each step has explicit inputs/outputs and can produce artifacts
- **Optional agent**: helps generate/refine workflows (opt-in)

## Control plane vs execution plane

In the recommended Docker deployment, Maia is split into two services:

- **App (control plane)**: UI + scheduler/state machine + SQLite + real-time SSE
- **Runner (execution plane)**: starts/stops sandbox containers and streams stdout/stderr back to App

This architecture lets you scale and operate “orchestration/state” separately from “execution/isolation”.

## When do you need Maia?

- Your jobs **run for a long time** (minutes/hours/days) and need reliable state persistence
- You want **full observability** for every run (real-time logs, outputs, inputs, artifacts)
- After failures, you want to **retry/rerun/replay** instead of relying on “black-box scripts”
- You want to break automation into **composable steps**, with visualization and debugging in the UI
