Local Dev mode is usually used for quick **development/debugging**. In Dev mode, steps execution can be independent of Runner / sandbox isolation.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm
- Git

## Start Maia

<Steps>
1. Clone the source repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/obiscr/maia.git
   cd maia
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Generate Prisma Client & initialize database

   ```bash
   pnpm prisma:generate
   pnpm prisma:migrate
   ```

4. Start development service

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
</Steps>

Then open:

## Data storage location

In local mode, data will be stored in the following location by default.

- **macOS**: `/Users/alice/Library/Application Support/maia-data`
- **Linux**: `/home/alice/.local/share/maia-data`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\alice\AppData\Local\maia-data`

## Get updates

When `maia` repository has updates, run the following commands in the source code directory:

```bash
git pull
pnpm install
```

### Update database

If the update includes database migrations (new or modified table structures), you need to run the migration command:

```bash
pnpm prisma:migrate
```

This command will apply new migration files from the `prisma/migrations/` directory.

<Aside type="note" title="About migration">
In local Dev mode, it is recommended that you explicitly run `pnpm prisma:migrate` after each code update to avoid runtime errors due to outdated database versions.
</Aside>

### Start the service

After completing the migration, start the dev service:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

If you have local uncommitted changes, resolve conflicts/commit them first before updating.
