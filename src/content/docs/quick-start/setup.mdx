On the first launch of Maia, opening `http://localhost:3690` will take you to the setup wizard. You can also visit `/setup` directly.

The goal of this wizard is: **write Maia’s base configuration into the data directory and create the first admin account**.

The wizard has 4 steps: Appearance → Data directory/Database → Admin → Done.

## Appearance

![Setup appearance](~/assets/tutorial/setup-appearance.png)

Choose your preferred theme and language. This only affects the UI and doesn’t impact execution.

- **Theme**: system / light / dark
- **Language**: English / Chinese (Simplified)

## Database

<Aside type="note" title="Tip">
The default database path is `/app/maia-data`. If you want to use a custom data directory, set `MAIA_DATA_DIR` in environment variables and restart the Docker containers.
</Aside>

![Setup database](~/assets/tutorial/setup-database.png)

Maia uses **SQLite** by default. This page is actually selecting the “instance data directory (Data Directory)”—the database file, configuration, and runtime data will all live here. You can think of it as Maia’s “working directory”.

- **Database file**: `<data directory>/db.sqlite`
- **Instance config file**: `<data directory>/settings/instance.json`. The wizard writes your chosen path into this file.

When you finish this step and proceed, it usually means:

- The data directory is writable
- Maia can create/read the SQLite database file in that directory

## Admin account

Create the first admin account. After successful creation you’ll be logged in automatically:

- **Name**: required
- **Email**: required, must be a valid email format
- **Password**: 8–256 characters
- **Confirm password**: must match the password

<Aside type="note" title="Registration is disabled by default">
After setup, the system defaults registration mode to **DISABLED** (public sign-ups are off). You can adjust the registration policy later in “Preferences → System”.

## Done
