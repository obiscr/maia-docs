The workflow editor uses a graph-first design to visualize and manage DAGs.

## Editor interface

The editor consists of the following parts:

- **Graph View** - Display step nodes and dependencies
- **Step List** - List all steps and their basic information
- **Code Editor** - Edit the script code of the selected step
- **Configuration Panel** - Set the key, name, timeout, etc. of the step

## Create and manage steps

### Add steps

The `Add Step` button above the editor can add steps. Clicking the added step node will enter the step editing mode.

The configurable items are:

- **Step Key**: `stepKey`, the stable unique identifier of the step, used for dependency reference and upstream output reading.
- **Name**: The readable name for UI display.
- **Timeout**: The maximum execution time for a single step execution, exceeding which will terminate the execution and mark the step as failed.
- **Script (ESM)**: The execution logic code of the step.

### Delete steps

- Right-click on the step to delete
- Select the step and press the backspace key to delete
- Select one or more nodes in selection mode, and delete in the context menu of the editor

### Disconnect steps

- Right-click on the connection to disconnect
- Select the connection and press the backspace key to delete
- Right-click on the step to disconnect the dependency
